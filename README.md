## Introduction

SolFHE is a groundbreaking project that combines the power of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) with Solana's high-performance blockchain to create a privacy-preserving, decentralized advertising platform. By leveraging FHE, SolFHE allows for personalized ad targeting without compromising user data privacy.

### What is Fully Homomorphic Encryption?

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a revolutionary form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first. This enables secure, privacy-preserving data processing in untrusted environments, making it ideal for applications like our decentralized advertising platform.

## Features

- **Privacy-Preserving Ad Targeting**: Utilize user data for ad matching without exposing sensitive information.
- **High-Performance**: Built on Solana for fast, low-cost transactions.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Interact with other blockchains through Hyperlane integration.
- **Advertiser Dashboard**: Easy-to-use interface for creating and managing ad campaigns.
- **User Control**: Users have full control over their data and can choose to participate in ad programs.
- **Transparent Reporting**: Blockchain-based verification of ad performance and payments.
- **Advanced FHE Operations**: Implement sophisticated homomorphic operations for secure data processing.

## FHE Implementation

SolFHE utilizes cutting-edge FHE techniques to ensure maximum privacy and security. Our implementation is based on state-of-the-art research in homomorphic encryption.

### Staged Evaluation

We implement a staged evaluation process for our FHE operations, as illustrated in the following diagram:

![Staged Evaluation Diagram](solfhe-frontend/public/scheme.png)

This multi-stage approach allows for complex computations on encrypted data, enabling sophisticated ad matching algorithms without compromising user privacy.

### Homomorphic Scheme Hierarchy

Our FHE implementation follows a hierarchical structure of homomorphic schemes, ensuring both efficiency and security:

![Homomorphic Scheme Hierarchy](solfhe-frontend/public/staged-eva.png)

This hierarchy allows us to optimize our FHE operations based on the specific requirements of each computation, balancing performance and security.

## Architecture

SolFHE consists of three main components:

1. **Solana Program**: A Rust-based smart contract that handles core functionality and interacts with the FHE layer.
2. **Frontend Application**: A Next.js application that provides the user interface for advertisers and users.
3. **FHE Layer**: Implements the Fully Homomorphic Encryption for secure data processing, including the staged evaluation and homomorphic scheme hierarchy.

## Installation

To set up the SolFHE project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solfhe.git
cd solfhe

# Install dependencies for the Solana program
cd program
cargo build

# Install dependencies for the frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your specific configurations
```

## Usage

To run the project locally:

1. Start the Solana test validator:
   ```bash
   solana-test-validator
   ```

2. Deploy the Solana program:
   ```bash
   anchor deploy
   ```

3. Run the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
